# Dunglover

## Description
You control a poop-rolling dung beetle, pulling off intricate platforming manoeuvres to solve problems for the quirky mountain residents.

Cover eggs, eyeballs, oranges and more in layers of coloured dung, roll 'em around - and then shed the layers to activate unique platforming abilities to get the objects to their destinations!

## Features
* 🪲 Control an adorable (but stinky!) dung beetle as you run, fly and roll around with intricate and tight platforming controls
* 🎨 Cover your ball with unlockable layers of dung each with a unique platforming ability
* 🧶 Many different balls to collect and bring back to their rightful owners!
* 🌍 Explore a single tightly-packed world with lots of hidden secrets
* 🦭 Help a selection of quirky characters each requiring you to master your ball-handling skills

## Roadmap
Dunglover is currently in the early prototyping stage with the intention of publishing a short demo in future. Progress will be shared through devlogs!
